                <p>Entrepreneurial Competition was one of the different and exciting project created to challenge your creativity and business minds!
                    Through 15 StartUp missions and customized teaching, you must come up with a business idea based on one of the following categories:
                    GreenTech,service innovation,life tech and social entreprenaurship and our group chose life and green tech,after all the brainstorming
                    and research our group came up with the idea to create pencils with implanted spores or orchid seeds, whereas the pencil is sharpened 
                    and the planted fiber and edible mushrooms would grow. However, since this idea was hard to execute we thought of changing our idea into 
                    something different and unique. We came up with the idea of making pencils out of paper and within that paper, the seeds would be implemented
                    and that comes under life and green tech,moreover Our target group is mainly targeted among 30-60 year olds living either in Europe or 
                    the United States regardless of the gender. We chose our target group by researching orchid forums. We previously had some comprehension 
                    that people who grow orchids tend to be quite infatuated by them, thus we took to the internet to confirm this. Turned out that that was
                    indeed true, orchid lovers would gather in various dedicated forums such as https://www.orchidsforum.com/forums/introduce-yourself.2/
